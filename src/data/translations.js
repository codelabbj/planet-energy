Throughout his studies, he worked for four (04) years at Skytron Energy GmbH as a system analyst in the O&M department and as a Project Engineer for solar power plants. In 2015 he was International Director of Renewable Energy at Luxra AG. During his youth, he identified the need to modernize Benin's electrical networks, his native country, and the integration of renewable energy to meet long-term energy needs safely. Thus, after his studies, he decided to dedicate himself to his great dream of solving the energy problems of Benin and other African countries to achieve a sustainable future and development. Thus, Mr. Mauriel Romaric AHODI, following the creation of the international company Planet Energy Systems, specialized in renewable energies, decided to put the skills and experience acquired during his professional journey at the service of the direction of this company in relation with its German partners."

                content: "Halogens (also known as \"salt-forming agents\") are chemical elements such as chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), fluorine (F), and iodine (I). In cable manufacturing, they are used to make certain conductor insulation and jacket materials flame retardant: Chlorine (as a component of PVC plastic or chloroprene rubber) and fluorine (as part of high-temperature FEP, PTFE, and ETFE materials) are particularly used here. Bromine is also used in flame retardants for cables and wires.",
                problem: "The problem: in the event of a fire, halogens are extremely aggressive and harmful. They produce hydrogen halides which, on contact with moisture, turn into acids and can cause respiratory burns. In addition, the released acids cause corrosion of metal parts and can thus damage machines and even the reinforcement of concrete elements in buildings. This in turn can lead to complex and costly decontamination work."

However, there are many applications that also require explicitly halogen-free products, i.e., cables and wires whose materials are free of chlorine, bromine, fluorine, and iodine. In the event of a fire, these produce only little acid, smoke, and lower toxicity, which considerably reduces consequential damage to people, buildings, and machines. However, even halogen-free lines produce toxic gases like carbon monoxide in the event of a fire.",

Dans la fabrication de câbles, ils servent à rendre certains matériaux d'isolation des conducteurs et de gaine ignifuges : Le chlore (en tant que composant du plastique PVC ou du caoutchouc chloroprène) et le fluor (en tant que partie des matériaux haute température FEP, PTFE et ETFE) sont notamment utilisés ici. Le brome est également utilisé dans les produits ignifuges pour les câbles et les fils.",
                problem: "Le problème : en cas d'incendie, les halogènes sont extrêmement agressifs et nocifs. Ils produisent des halogénures d'hydrogène qui, au contact de l'humidité, se transforment en acides et peuvent provoquer des brûlures des voies respiratoires. En outre, les acides libérés entraînent la corrosion des pièces métalliques et peuvent ainsi endommager les machines et même l'armature des éléments en béton dans les bâtiments. Cela peut à son tour entraîner des travaux de décontamination complexes et coûteux."

Il existe toutefois de nombreuses applications qui nécessitent également des produits explicitement sans halogène, c'est-à-dire des câbles et des fils dont les matériaux sont exempts de chlore, de brome, de fluor et d'iode. En cas d'incendie, ceux-ci ne produisent que peu d'acide, de fumée et une toxicité moindre, ce qui permet de réduire considérablement les dommages consécutifs sur les personnes, les bâtiments et les machines. Toutefois, même les conduites sans halogène produisent des gaz toxiques comme le monoxyde de carbone en cas d'incendie.",
