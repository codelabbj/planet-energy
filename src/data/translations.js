Alongside his studies, he worked for four (04) years at Skytron Energy GmbH as a systems analyst in the O&M department and as a project engineer for solar power plants. In 2015, he was International Director of Renewable Energy at Luxra AG. Since his youth, he identified the need for modernizing electrical grids in Benin, his native country, and integrating renewable energy to meet energy needs long-term and safely. Thus, after his studies, he decided to devote himself to his great dream of solving energy problems in Benin and other African countries to achieve a sustainable future and development. M. Mauriel Romaric AHODI, following the creation of the international company Planet Energy Systems specializing in renewable energies, decided to put the skills and experience acquired during his career at the service of this company in partnership with its German counterparts."

But what is the meaning of these abbreviations and what are the advantages of halogen-free cables compared to halogen-containing products? Planet Energy informs you.",

                title: "What are halogens?",
                content: "Halogens (also known as \"salt-forming agents\") are chemical elements such as chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), fluorine (F), and iodine (I). In cable manufacturing, they are used to make certain conductor insulation and jacket materials flame retardant: Chlorine (as a component of PVC plastic or chloroprene rubber) and fluorine (as part of high-temperature FEP, PTFE, and ETFE materials) are particularly used here. Bromine is also used in flame retardants for cables and wires.",
                problem: "The problem: in the event of a fire, halogens are extremely aggressive and harmful. They produce hydrogen halides which, on contact with moisture, turn into acids and can cause respiratory burns. In addition, the released acids cause corrosion of metal parts and can thus damage machines and even the reinforcement of concrete elements in buildings. This in turn can lead to complex and costly decontamination work."

                title: "Safety first",
                content: "For fire protection reasons, the flame resistance of cables and wires is obviously an important criterion. However, there are many applications that also require explicitly halogen-free products, i.e., cables and wires whose materials are free of chlorine, bromine, fluorine, and iodine. In the event of a fire, these produce only little acid, smoke, and lower toxicity, which considerably reduces consequential damage to people, buildings, and machines. However, even halogen-free lines produce toxic gases like carbon monoxide in the event of a fire.",

Parallèlement durant ses études, il a travaillé pendant quatre (04) ans dans la société Skytron Energy GmbH en tant qu'analyste système dans le département O & M et comme Ingénieur de projets pour des centrales solaires. En 2015 il a été directeur international des énergies renouvelables dans la société Luxra AG. Déjà pendant sa jeunesse, il a identifié la nécessité de la modernisation des réseaux électriques du Bénin son pays natal et l'intégration de l'énergie renouvelable pour répondre aux besoins énergétiques à long terme et en toute sécurité. Ainsi, après ses études, il a décidé de se consacrer sur son grand rêve qui est de résoudre les problèmes énergétiques du Bénin et des autres pays d'Afrique afin d'aboutir à un avenir et développement durable. C'est ainsi que M. Mauriel Romaric AHODI, suite à la création de la Société internationale Planet Energy Systems, spécialisée dans les énergies renouvelables, a décidé de mettre les compétences et les expériences acquises durant son parcours professionnel au service de la direction de cette entreprise en relation avec ces partenaires allemands."

            intro: "Les câbles sans halogène sont obligatoires dans de nombreuses applications de l'industrie et de l'infrastructure. Avec le temps, différentes désignations se sont établies, comme FRNC, HFFR, LS0H ou LSZH. Mais quelle est la signification de ces abréviations et quels sont les avantages des câbles sans halogène par rapport aux produits contenant des halogènes ? Planet Energy vous informe.",

                title: "Que sont les halogènes ?",
                content: "Les halogènes (également connus sous le nom \"d'agents salifiants\") sont des éléments chimiques tels que le chlore (Cl), le brome (Br), le fluor (F) et l'iode (I). Dans la fabrication de câbles, ils servent à rendre certains matériaux d'isolation des conducteurs et de gaine ignifuges : Le chlore (en tant que composant du plastique PVC ou du caoutchouc chloroprène) et le fluor (en tant que partie des matériaux haute température FEP, PTFE et ETFE) sont notamment utilisés ici. Le brome est également utilisé dans les produits ignifuges pour les câbles et les fils.",
                problem: "Le problème : en cas d'incendie, les halogènes sont extrêmement agressifs et nocifs. Ils produisent des halogénures d'hydrogène qui, au contact de l'humidité, se transforment en acides et peuvent provoquer des brûlures des voies respiratoires. En outre, les acides libérés entraînent la corrosion des pièces métalliques et peuvent ainsi endommager les machines et même l'armature des éléments en béton dans les bâtiments. Cela peut à son tour entraîner des travaux de décontamination complexes et coûteux."

                content: "Pour des raisons de protection contre l'incendie, la résistance à la flamme des câbles et des fils est évidemment un critère important. Il existe toutefois de nombreuses applications qui nécessitent également des produits explicitement sans halogène, c'est-à-dire des câbles et des fils dont les matériaux sont exempts de chlore, de brome, de fluor et d'iode. En cas d'incendie, ceux-ci ne produisent que peu d'acide, de fumée et une toxicité moindre, ce qui permet de réduire considérablement les dommages consécutifs sur les personnes, les bâtiments et les machines. Toutefois, même les conduites sans halogène produisent des gaz toxiques comme le monoxyde de carbone en cas d'incendie.",

Parallel zu seinem Studium arbeitete er vier (04) Jahre bei der Skytron Energy GmbH als Systemanalyst in der O&M-Abteilung und als Projektingenieur für Solarkraftwerke. Im Jahr 2015 war er Internationaler Direktor für Erneuerbare Energien bei der Luxra AG. Seit seiner Jugend sah er die Notwendigkeit der Modernisierung der Stromnetze in Benin, seinem Heimatland, und die Integration erneuerbarer Energien, um den Energiebedarf langfristig und sicher zu decken. So entschied er sich nach seinem Studium, sich seinem großen Traum zu widmen, die Energieprobleme in Benin und anderen afrikanischen Ländern zu lösen, um eine nachhaltige Zukunft und Entwicklung zu erreichen. Herr Mauriel Romaric AHODI entschied sich nach der Gründung des internationalen Unternehmens Planet Energy Systems, das auf erneuerbare Energien spezialisiert ist, die während seiner Karriere erworbenen Fähigkeiten und Erfahrungen in den Dienst dieses Unternehmens in Partnerschaft mit seinen deutschen Kollegen zu stellen."

            intro: "Halogenfreie Kabel sind in vielen Bereichen der Industrie und Infrastruktur vorgeschrieben. Im Laufe der Zeit haben sich verschiedene Bezeichnungen etabliert wie FRNC, HFFR, LS0H oder LSZH. Doch was bedeuten diese Abkürzungen und welche Vorteile bieten halogenfreie Leitungen gegenüber halogenhaltigen Produkten? Planet Energy informiert.",
            section1: {
                title: "Was sind Halogene?",
                content: "Halogene (auch als \"Salzbildner\" bekannt) sind chemische Elemente wie Chlor (Cl), Brom (Br), Fluor (F) und Jod (I). In der Kabelherstellung dienen sie dazu, bestimmte Aderisolier- und Mantelwerkstoffe flammwidrig zu machen: Besonders Chlor (als Bestandteil des Kunststoffs PVC oder von Chloropren-Kautschuk) und Fluor (als Teil der Hochtemperaturwerkstoffe FEP, PTFE und ETFE) kommen hier zum Einsatz. Auch Brom wird in Flammschutzmitteln für Kabel und Leitungen verwendet.",
                problem: "Das Problem: Im Brandfall sind Halogene extrem aggressiv und gesundheitsschädlich. Es entstehen Halogenwasserstoffe, die bei Kontakt mit Feuchtigkeit zu Säuren werden und Verätzungen der Atemwege verursachen können. Zudem führen die freigesetzten Säuren zur Korrosion von Metallteilen und können so Maschinen und sogar die Bewehrung von Betonelementen in Gebäuden beschädigen. Dies kann wiederum aufwendige und teure Sanierungsarbeiten nach sich ziehen."

            section2: {
                title: "Sicherheit geht vor",
                content: "Aus Gründen des Brandschutzes ist die Flammwidrigkeit von Kabeln und Leitungen natürlich ein wichtiges Kriterium. Es gibt jedoch viele Anwendungen, die zusätzlich explizit halogenfreie Produkte fordern – also Kabel und Leitungen, deren Werkstoffe frei von Chlor, Brom, Fluor und Jod sind.
