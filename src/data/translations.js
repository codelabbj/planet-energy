Throughout his studies, he worked for four (04) years at Skytron Energy GmbH as a system analyst in the O&M department and as a Project Engineer for solar power plants. In 2015 he was International Director of Renewable Energy at Luxra AG. During his youth, he identified the need to modernize Benin's electrical networks, his native country, and the integration of renewable energy to meet long-term energy needs safely. Thus, after his studies, he decided to dedicate himself to his great dream of solving the energy problems of Benin and other African countries to achieve a sustainable future and development. Thus, Mr. Mauriel Romaric AHODI, following the creation of the international company Planet Energy Systems, specialized in renewable energies, decided to put the skills and experience acquired during his professional journey at the service of the direction of this company in relation with its German partners."

Parallèlement durant ses études, il a travaillé pendant quatre (04) ans dans la société Skytron Energy GmbH en tant qu'analyste système dans le département O & M et comme Ingénieur de projets pour des centrales solaires. En 2015 il a été directeur international des énergies renouvelables dans la société Luxra AG. Déjà pendant sa jeunesse, il a identifié la nécessité de la modernisation des réseaux électriques du Bénin son pays natal et l'intégration de l'énergie renouvelable pour répondre aux besoins énergétiques à long terme et en toute sécurité. Ainsi, après ses études, il a décidé de se consacrer sur son grand rêve qui est de résoudre les problèmes énergétiques du Bénin et des autres pays d'Afrique afin d'aboutir à un avenir et développement durable. C'est ainsi que M. Mauriel Romaric AHODI, suite à la création de la Société internationale Planet Energy Systems, spécialisée dans les énergies renouvelables, a décidé de mettre les compétences et les expériences acquises durant son parcours professionnel au service de la direction de cette entreprise en relation avec ces partenaires allemands."
